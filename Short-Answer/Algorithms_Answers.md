## Exercise I

a. RTC for O(n) is because the each input is n* n so after the n iteration of input it will be equal to n*(n*n) which is exactly what the loop is doing.


b. RTC is O(nlog(n)). This is because of the nested while loop in the for loop. The for loop will run n times on the input and the while loop will run logn times on the input. 


c. RTC is 0(n)recursive function and it calls itself n times. The function goes through itself when it hits the base case. It adds 2 to the return value and runs through itself ntimes and since adding 2 is a constant operation, and it is done n times... then RTC is 0(n).
